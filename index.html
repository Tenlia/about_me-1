    <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>Born in Philadelphia, Alison has an adventurous side that has taken her all over the world. Working odd jobs and harvests allowed her to travel for 6 months every year for many years. These travels led her to spend extended amounts of time in 5 of the 7 continents. Throughout her travels and time spent abroad, Alison discovered that she has a knack for picking up languages and was passionate about indigenous languages. This led her to pursue a formal education in linguistics. As a linguistics student, Alison focused on documentation of endangered languages. Her undergraduate research looked at the Purepecha community, originally from Mexico, while her graduate studies centered around Iquito, a language from the Peruvian Amazon. Alison is a strong supporter of indigenous language rights, revitalization and reclamation. She hopes to continue her linguistic work with the indigenous Seattle language, Lushootseed.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
      <img id = "goals" src = http://opencuny.org/languagerevitalizationinthe21stcentury/files/2011/11/cropped-conferencebanner21.jpg width = "500 px" height="125 px"><p> My main goal is to gain skills which will compliment my linguistics skillset. I aspire to have a job, outside of academia, in which I can continue to be a linguist. I also intend to use my coding skills to create online content and learning materials for the Lushootseed community here in the PNW. With approximately 100 Lushootseed speakers remaining, this language is highly endangered. There is a thriving community working to revitalize the language through teaching it at home, in school, incorporating the language into tribal events and many other methods. However, there is no web presence or thorough online learning platform to engage the next generation. As the younger generation are the ones who will ultimately carry on this language, it is pertinent that online material be made available to assist in this effort. I aspire to begin to work on this and have received the blessing and encouragement from several Lushootseed language activists to pursue this path.
